# **1)How would you define Machine Learning?**

     -Machine learning is an algorithm that allows computers to learn. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intilligence.
     - It is classified into two types :- 
                                          1) SUPERVISED LEARNING         2)UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

# **2) What are the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning? Specify example 3 algorithms for each of these.**
###  **SUPERVISED LEARNING**
  
     - Supervised Learing is a process of learning from the labelled training data by a machine.
     - Supervised Learning is Classified into 2 types:-

           1)Supervised Classification :- 
     


           2)Supervised Regression

###  **UNSUPERVISED LEARNING**
     - Unsupervised Learning is non labelled and unclarified information in analysis to discover hidden knowledge .
     - Unsupervised learning classified into 1 type :
           
       1) Clusturing :-  It refers to a board set of techniques for finding subgroups,or clusters.

3) What are the test and validation set, and why would you want to use them?
4) What are the main preprocessing steps? Explain them in detail. Why we need to prepare our data?
5) How you can explore countionus and discrete variables?
6) Analyse the plot given below. (What is the plot and variable type, check the distribution and make comment about how you can preproccess it.)
